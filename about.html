            always been on the patients of the lower and middle sections of society, <br> patients who are rejected by the
            large corporate hospitals, and who cannot afford expensive medical care but definitely <br> deserve empathy. They
            believe that medicine is a noble profession and sick must not be rejected on monetary grounds.
